    <title>help ukraine achieve peace and freedom. stand with ukraine for its right to sovereignty and independence.</title>
    <meta name='description' content='My position is as follows: I firmly condemn the actions of the current Russian government, which operates through aggression, lies, and disinformation. I consider this government illegitimate, as power has been transferred between rulers under the guise of elections that were, in reality, mere formalities. The entire state apparatus uses propaganda, strict censorship, and suppression of the opposition to manipulate public opinion and maintain the illusion of consent.The events of February 24, when Russia once again invaded Ukraine, became yet another confirmation that this regime retains power through intimidation and manipulation. The government destroys any independent sources of information, declaring the truth to be «fake news», while journalists and activists who attempt to speak out are subjected to persecution, arrests, and repression. This regime is built on fear and lies, on artificially created threats designed to control people&#039;s minds and suppress any honest criticism.Because of my stance, I was forced to flee my home country, as I began facing persecution for refusing to remain silent. But the pressure on me did not come solely from state structures. Many people who were once close to me have turned away, despise me, and openly confront me simply because I do not accept the idea that the killing of innocent people can be justified. I cannot accept the term «collateral damage», because it dehumanizes the victims, conceals the horrific reality of this war, and reduces human tragedy to mere statistics.I see how meticulously these crimes are being concealed. One example can be found in an Instagram post, where a Russian attack on civilian targets in Ukraine is documented. These strikes destroy hospitals, schools, residential buildings, and vital infrastructure, causing immense suffering to innocent people, including women, children, and the elderly. In Russia, all of this truth is silenced, and those who attempt to expose it face severe repression, criminal charges, and imprisonment.But I refuse to stay silent. In my free time, I create projects that help spread truthful information about the war, the crimes of the regime, and the corruption within the Russian government. I make these services free, open, and accessible to everyone who seeks to know the truth and speak it out loud. I fully understand that I am paying for this with my own well-being and the safety of my family.However, justice and freedom of speech are far more important to me than wealth or recognition.I want to see a world where people are not afraid to speak the truth, where every voice matters.
