    "question": "Help Ukraine",
    "answer": "<h2>🧭 My Position</h2>\n<p>I firmly and consciously condemn the actions of the current Russian government, which rules through <strong>aggression, lies, and disinformation</strong>. I consider this regime <strong>illegitimate</strong>, as power in Russia has never been transferred through free and fair elections. The entire state apparatus relies on <strong>propaganda, strict censorship, and the suppression of dissent</strong> to manipulate public opinion and maintain the illusion of consent.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>⚔️ The War as Proof of a Criminal Regime</h2>\n<p>I have opposed Russia’s actions against Ukraine <strong>since 2014</strong>. Even then, I viewed the <strong>annexation of Crimea</strong> as a <strong>military and political crime</strong>, a violation of international law and a betrayal of justice and peace.</p>\n<p>When Russia launched its full-scale invasion on <strong>February 24, 2022</strong>, it became unmistakably clear: this regime survives solely through <strong>intimidation, violence, and lies</strong>.</p>\n<p>It crushes any independent source of information, labeling truth as \"fake news.\" Those who speak out face <strong>harassment, arrest, and imprisonment</strong>. This regime is built on <strong>fear and systematic deception</strong>, constantly inventing enemies to keep society under control.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>🚪 Why I Had to Flee</h2>\n<p>Because of my position, I was subjected to <strong>pressure and threats</strong> and eventually forced to leave my country to protect my freedom and safety. What hurt the most was that <strong>many people close to me turned away</strong> simply because I refused to support war or justify the killing of innocent people.</p>\n<p>I will never accept the term <strong>\"collateral damage\"</strong> — it <strong>dehumanizes the victims, hides the brutal reality of war, and reduces human tragedy to mere statistics</strong>.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>🔇 The Truth They Try to Silence</h2>\n<p>I see how meticulously these crimes are being concealed.<br><strong>Here is one example: <a rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C9KAuhJo4VF/?hl=en&amp;img_index=8\">an Instagram post documenting a Russian strike on civilians</a></strong>.</p>\n<p>These attacks destroy <strong>hospitals, schools, homes, and critical infrastructure</strong>. They kill and injure <strong>women, children, and the elderly</strong>. In Russia, this truth is <strong>silenced</strong>, and anyone who dares expose it is met with <strong>repression, criminal charges, and prison sentences</strong>.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>🛠️ I Don’t Stay Silent — I Act</h2>\n<p><strong>Silence destroys truth, and one-sided information destroys the freedom to think.</strong><br>That’s why I create and maintain platforms where people can <strong>share information freely — without fear for their safety or freedom</strong>.</p>\n<p>These are spaces for thought, testimony, experience, and dissent — not controlled by any ideology. I do not dictate what is true. <strong>I provide space for people to speak</strong>, and I trust readers to <strong>decide for themselves what to believe, question, and understand</strong>.</p>\n<p>I am convinced that only through <strong>diverse perspectives</strong> can we truly <strong>see the world, not just distorted shadows of it</strong>.<br>That’s why my platforms are <strong>free, independent, and open to all</strong>. I fund them <strong>personally — emotionally, physically, and financially —</strong> because I believe in what they stand for.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><a rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://inwrite.org/\"><strong>inWrite</strong></a> — 📝 a user-friendly platform for anonymous online publishing.</p></li>\n<li><p><a rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://inwrite.org/chat/\"><strong>inChat</strong></a> — 💬 a secure anonymous messenger for communication.</p></li>\n<li><p><a rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://inwrite.github.io/inMail/\"><strong>inMail</strong></a> — 📫 a service for temporary, anonymous email reception.</p></li>\n<li><p><a rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://wopr.ru/\"><strong>WoPr</strong></a> — 🌐 free website creation and hosting with WordPress CMS.</p></li>\n<li><p><a rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://wikli.ru/\"><strong>Wikli</strong></a> — 🧩 WordPress-based website builder (2025).</p></li>\n<li><p><a rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://inwrite.github.io/protest\"><strong>Protest</strong></a> — 🎨 collection of my SVG artwork (CC0 license).</p></li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2>🌍 What I Believe In</h2>\n<p>I want to live in a world where <strong>people are not afraid to speak the truth</strong>, where <strong>every voice matters</strong>.<br>And I’m ready to fight for that world.<br><br><audio controls=''><source src='index-file/ukr/I-wanna-say.mp3' type='audio/mpeg'></audio></p>\n<hr>\n<div class='randomimg'><img class='randomsvg' src='index-file/ukr/stop_putin_stop_war.svg' alt='Random SVG'><button id='loadImageButton' class='btn-secondary'>🔁 Refresh image</button><a class='' href='https://inwrite.github.io/protest' target='_blank'>✊ Protest</a></div>",
