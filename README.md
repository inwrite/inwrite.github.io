# Hello World! ðŸ‘‹ I am Mikhail

**I am a web developer specializing in supporting small and medium-sized businesses in achieving success online.** My mission is to help companies increase their visibility on the web and strengthen customer relationships through effective and reliable web solutions.

In addition to client work, I am the founder and visionary behind several personal projects:

- [inWrite](https://inwrite.org/) â€” a convenient platform for anonymous online publishing, allowing you to share thoughts and ideas without registration.
- [inChat](https://inwrite.org/chat/) â€” a secure anonymous messenger for online communication and message exchange.
- [inMail](https://inwrite.github.io/inMail/) â€” a service providing temporary email addresses for anonymous and secure receipt of emails.
- [WoPr](https://wopr.ru/) â€” a platform offering free creation and hosting of websites of any complexity on the WordPress CMS.
- [UsInk](https://usink.ru/) â€” a service for creating and hosting simple business card websites, suitable for personal and professional purposes.
- [Protest](https://inwrite.github.io/protest/) â€” a collection of my artwork and covers in SVG format, available under the Creative Commons Zero (CC0) license.

For those interested in my early projects, [my old portfolio](https://inwrite.github.io/xiv/) is also available for review.

I am always open to new challenges and strive to find innovative solutions that help businesses grow and adapt to modern demands.
